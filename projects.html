                <h1> FlashPoint cooperation game </h1>
                <h3> Develop a software engeneering project from start to finish using
                    use case model, enviromental model, protocol model up to the code and final product
                </h3>
                <p>
                   This is an ungoing project that I am currently working on with a team of six since september to 
                   be finished by april of this year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The goal is to reproduce the FlashPoint game, a multi-player cooperative game where players must unite in order
                    to save victims left in a building on fire, this project thought me how to think of software engineering
                    development processes including producing the models above to get a clear picture of the software development
                    coming ahead. Beside the domain and sequence diagram that I had already learned in previous classes, I find the 
                    use case model extremely powerful as it gives a clear understanding of the steps and outside architecture
                    that the system will have to take, giving us a dynamic perspective and practical perspective on what is left to build
                    that is not always present in the other models.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are using java for the back end and the libgdx library for the GUI and thinking of using NodeJS for 
                    the network aspect of the product.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am responsible for developing the back-end aspect of the game using the object oriented approach, I 
                    find it very pleasing to finally get to apply design pattern in a concrete project!

                <h3> Design and deploy a database system</h3>
                <p>
                    The project first consisted of developing the requirement specification for the database through the ER diagram. Then I
                    created the tables, views and meaningful SQL queries on our model. Finally, I wrote an UI in python using the Tkinter
                    library to allow a user to add/delete data from the database along with getting visual results when performing SQL queries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That experience gave me a better insight on how databases are created and deployed in modern companies, along with team management
                    since I ended up doing most of the project aspects as it became more complex. In the future I think meetings where every group member
                    takes the time to present their work and the area that their contributions cover to another team member is a great asset when doing
                    such projects to ensure that no team member lags behind and a coherent clear understanding of the task remaining is established.

            <h1> Gravity </h1>
            <h3> Stimulate planetary orbits and the basics of data saving using JSON</h3>
            <p>
                This project was developed when applying for an internship in a company who focused on stimulation of systems. 
                This system was developed in python using the Tkinter library.
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal was to be able to stimulate planets interaction in the universe, the end results mimics that idea.
                I also wanted to experiment with saving and loading data, so I used JSON encoding to save planets and allow the user
                to load saved planetary stimulation.
            </p>

            <p>
                This project thought me a lot regarding the use and intricate understanding required when using libraries, in my case 
                I solve certain rendering problems and JSON saving problems by recreating or going around certain methods provided by the libraries
                which led to an interesting final code similar to abstract art in a sense. Note to self when using libraries make sure you understand their basics
                before jumping into the code and try to make things work your way no matter what.

                <h1> Dungeon Crawler </h1>
                <h3>Developed as part of a class project and the first project ever done in a team for me</h3>
                <p>
                    The goal was to create a DungeonCrawler game in html using C or python for the back end, each team
                    had to code one room of the Dungeon, our challenge consisted on selecting a category and find the scrambled word 
                    related to that category. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As my first project done in a team, I must say that it went really well my partners and I had the same views over
                    how to code and display the game, along with the same passion for the project so everything ran really smoothly through the development phase.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was responsible to design the game script, I decided to develop it in python as it was a new language to me at that time
                    and was easier to grasps than C. To further challenge myself I used and external source to generate the game
                    encoded in a CSV format. The harder part of the development was to transfer the information across the python and C scripts
                    and render the html page with the correct information. Overall it was a very interesting project that confirmed my interest
                    for software engineering.
