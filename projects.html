                <h3> Design and deploy a database system</h3>
                <p>
                    The project first consisted of developing the requierment specification for the database through the ER diagram. Then I
                    created the tables, views and meaningful SQL queries on our model. Finally I wrote an UI in python using the Tkinter
                    library to allow a user to add/delete data from the database along with getting visual results when performing SQL queries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That experience gave me a better insights on how database are created and deployed in modern companies, along with team managment
                    since I ended up doing most of the project aspect as the project became more complex. In the future I think sessions where every group member
                    takes the time to present their work and the area that their contributions cover to other team member is a great asset when doing
                    such projects to ensure that no team member lags behind.

            <h3> Stimulate plannetory orbits and basic data saving throuhg JSON strategies</h3>
            <p>
                This project was develop when applying for an internship in a company who focused on stimulation of systems. 
                This system was developed in python using the Tkinter library in python.
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal was to be able to stimulate plannets interaction in the universe, the end results mimics that idea.
                I also wanted to experiment with saving and loading data so I used JSON encoding to save planets and allow the user
                to load saved planetory stimulation

            <p>
                I learned a great deal from this project, first of all that
