            <h1> About me </h1>
            <p class="bellowline">
                Currently completing my last semester in Software Engineering at McGill University graduating this spring after 4 years in Canada.
                I originally started in Pharmacology, after auditing an intro to computer science class in summer 2016
                it was clear to me that this was my true passion so that same day I swaped major to Software Engineering.
                I am passionate about many different subjects in that department, Altough I am still a fresh new commer to this field to
                know what specific area interest me the most but so far, I really enjoy Computer Networks how information
                is transferred today with their protocols, I feel like this is an area that still has so much potential. On that
                same level we can find parallel computing with Moore's law slowly coming to an end with ever smaller transistors,
                this field appears as a new promising area with new solution that must be developed to keep increasing our computing power.

                I have lived in over 4 countries for the passed 12 years including Japan, India and Singapore which has open my mind on a lot of different culture.
                It was a rough experience at first as I had to leave all my conforts and friends behind but I would not be here today writting these lines
                if it had not happened.
                
                On the side my main passions include close up magic and everything that comes with it (juggling, unicycling). Improv that I 
                have been doing for the past 3 years. With climbing and recently kickboxing.
