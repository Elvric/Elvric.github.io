            <p class="bellowline">
                Currently completing my last semester in Software Engeneering at McGill University graduating this spring.
                I originally started in Pharmacology. But after auditing an intro to computer science class in summer 2016
                it was clear to me that something had to change so a swaped major to end up in Software Engeneering.
                I am passionate about many different subjects in that field, I feel like I am still too fresh to
                know what specific area interest me the most yet but so far I really enjoy Computer Networks how information
                is transfered today with their protocols, I feel like this is an area that still has so much potential. On that
                same level we can find parallel computing with Moore's law slowly coming to an end with ever smaller transistors,
                this field appears as a new promessing area with new solution that must be develloped to keep increasing our computing power.

                On the side my main passions include close up magic and every thing that comes with it (juggling, unicycling). Improv that I 
                have been doing for the passed 3 years. With climbing and recently kickboxing to keep a balance life.
