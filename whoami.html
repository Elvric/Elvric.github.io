                Currently completing my last semester in Software Engineering at McGill University graduating this spring.
                I originally started in Pharmacology. But after auditing an intro to computer science class in summer 2016
                it was clear to me that something had to change so a swapped major to end up in Software Engineering.
                I am passionate about many different subjects in that field, I feel like I am still too fresh to
                know what specific area interest me the most yet but so far, I really enjoy Computer Networks how information
                is transferred today with their protocols, I feel like this is an area that still has so much potential. On that
                same level we can find parallel computing with Moore's law slowly coming to an end with ever smaller transistors,
                this field appears as a new promising area with new solution that must be developed to keep increasing our computing power.

                On the side my main passions include close up magic and everything that comes with it (juggling, unicycling). Improv that I 
                have been doing for the past 3 years. With climbing and recently kickboxing to keep a balance life
